1) INTRODUCTION
  -------------

This is the autoreport plugin for Ducati League.
It was first dedicated to (the young) Showdown League and then it has been improved to fit the needs of the Ducati League.
The plugin consists in two parts :  (1) a bzfs plugin and (2) a webleague patch.

The bzfs plugin handles the events on the league match server. It also checks that an official match has satisfied enough 
the league rules in order to be reported. It catches informations from the webleague itself. Finally, it sends informations 
to the website such that the official match can be reported.

The webleague patch allows to catch informations in the webleague database and to send them to the bzfs plugin. It receives 
informations from the bzfs plugin to report or not an official match.

2) CREDITS

Author would like to friendly give special credits to the following people 

-- Brad who has nicely shared his original plugin.  It allow us to save a bunch of times since we didnt start from scratch.
-- Strayer who suggested modifications in the php script to prevent sql injection
-- Osta, Asmeouuus, Hurricane, ReX, Neofit who have participated at the premilarly (but still important) tests
-- Some annoying bzplayers (the list is too long for naming all of them) who make people so disgusted than they do a break with bzflag. 
   So it gave more time to be spent in the coding

 

3) SYNOPSIS 
   ---------

The plugin register to the following events :

bz_eCaptureEvent
bz_ePlayerSpawnEvent
bz_eGameStartEvent
bz_eSlashCommandEvent
bz_eGameEndEvent
bz_eTickEvent

It also implements command /cancel and /official

The command /official stands for an official declaration of a match. It is like a signature. Nevertheless, 
any official declaration (command /official) can be canceled at anytime by anyone with command /cancel
until command /countdown has been exectuted.

When player A run command /official, the bzfs plugin asks to webleague patch the name of player A's team.
The webleague patch would return the correct team name if player A belong to a team. Let denote it by TeamA.
Then the server informs  all the players that Team A is waiting for a challenger. This can still be canceled 
by command "/cancel" by anyone.    

If a second player enter command /official, the bzfs plugin would  get the player B's team nametoo in the same way
. Let denote it by Team B.  If Team A is also Team B then the plugin would inform that Team A cannot match against 
itself. Then, the match is not set in official mode. If Player A or/and Player B does not belong to any team, then 
a message is sent to all the players to inform on it. The match is not set in official mode. Otherwise the match is
 set in official mode. This mode can still be canceled by command "/cancel".    

After a match has been started in official mode, the plugin knows the name of the two teams that are playing. It is 
definitive. So a player cannot expect to escape from the autoreporting by leaving at the very last second of the game, 
as it used to be in a previous pluging running in Shodown League. This plugin has been written in order to prevent 
such a poor gaming.

After the countdown command, only players who belong to Team A or Team B can spawn. The bzfs plugin registers 
bz_ePlayerSpawnEvent to prevent players from other team to spawn during match... If a player who does not belong to any 
of the playing team tries to spawn, it would be kicked with a message that would informs him that an offical match is 
running. 

By the way, the bzfs plugin does not still know what is the color of each team (is Team A playing in green or in red ?). 
It is the reason why the bzfs plugin registers to  bz_eCaptureEvent.  The first time a flag is captured then the bzfs 
plugin get enough information to guess which team is playing in red and which team is playing in red. Of course, player 
can switch and mix team after. It would then fool the plugin that would report the match. But such an the identification 
procedure, it minimizes the internet bandwith with the webleague.

If a match is ended by command /gameover, then it will not be reported. So a match must go during the timelimit. This is 
handled by the registration to bz_eGameEndEvent.

During match, the bzfs plugin counts the amont of time in which teams Team A and Team B have more than 2 players. At the 
end of the match, the bzfs plugin compares the total duration for which Team A or/and Team B played with more than 
2 players. In case this amount of time is less than 90 percent of the timelimit (pauses are taken into account), then the 
match is not reported and a message is sent to players to inform them. The reason is that  N vs 1, and N vs 0 are not 
allowed by the Rules of Ducati leagues.

Finally, the bzfs plugin takes into account the total pause time (command /countdown /pause) and it is compatible with 
timelimit plugin. 


4) WEBLEAGUE PATCH INSTALL
   -----------------------

Let denote the root directory of your webleague installation by WEBDIR. Let also denote the directory where the files of the 
autoreport plugin are copied by SOURCEDIR. In order to install the webleague patch, files 

-- copy/overwrite the two files in SOURCEDIR (autoreport_plugin.php and index.php) to WEBDIR/
-- copy SOURCEDIR/webleague/section/autoreport.php into WEBDIR/section/
-- copy/overwrite files into SOURCEDIR/webleague/support/sqlscripts/create_new_install to  WEBDIR/support/sqlscripts/create_new_install
-- copy the directory  SOURCEDIR/webleague/support/sqlscripts/add_autoreport into WEBDIR/support/sqlscripts/

5) WEBLEAGUE PATCH USE
   -------------------

The next step is to update the sql database. Actually, a table will be added with respect to the default webleague database
Consequently, for a new install, just change directory to WEBDIR/support/sqlscripts/ and execute script runme.sh. In case 
of an update of an previously existing database, change directory to  WEBDIR/support/sqlscripts/add_autoreport and 
execute script runme.sh.

Let assume that WEBSITE_URL is the url of the webleague site. 
Connect to WEBSITE_URL and login as an admin. the frontend to add/edit/remove HASH string of official match league server is 
available thru the link "autoreport" in the admin panel. A new permission "AutoReport" has been introduced to allow/deny access
to the frontend. 

Create a new player with callsign "autoreport". All auto-reports will be made with its id (the password is not needed either by
the bzfs plugin or the webleague patch). 
 
6) BZFS PLUGIN INSTALL
   --------------------

Let again denote the directory where the files of the autoreport plugin are copied by SOURCEDIR. The first step is to change 
directory to SOURCEDIR/AutoReport. There is a MakeFile that allows to compile the plugin by just running the command make.  It will 
create a new file, AutoReport.so <-- it is the bzfs plugin!!!! Copy SOURCEDIR/AutoReport.so into a directory where it could be 
load by bzfs. Let denote by PLUGIN_PATH such a directory.

7) BZFS PLUGIN USE
   ----------------

The plugin can be loaded in the command line with the required parameters separated by a quote. The first parameter has to be 
the link of the php patch that handles connection with bzfs plugin. By default, it is  autoreport_handle.php. The second 
parameter is a hash string that is used to validate the identity of the bzfs server side. Let assume the hash string is 
774320FJCFIE9484292E2DE24. Consequently, the command line would be

bzfs -loadplugin PLUGIN_PATH/AutoReport.so,http://WEBSITE_URL/autoreport_handle.php,774320FJCFIE9484292E2DE24 [...]

It is recommended to change the default name of the file autoreport_handle.php into WEBDIR. It would improve security.
