INTRODUCTION
------------

This is the autoreport plugin for Ducati League by Murielle Darc (aka Cherry).
It was first dedicated to (the young) Showdown League and then it has been improved to fit the needs of the Ducati League.
The plugin consists in two parts :  (1) a bzfs plugin and (2) a webleague patch.

The bzfs plugin handles the events on the league match server. It catches informations from the webleague itself. Finally, it sends informations 
to the website in order the official match  be reported.

The webleague patch allows to catch informations in the webleague database and to send them to the bzfs plugin. It receives 
informations from the bzfs plugin to report an official match.

CREDITS
-------

they would know who are they!!!! credits is so important for the self estimates than some would not never happy and think there is too few.
So i decided to remove the content of this section.  Sorry for their ego.

SYNOPSIS 
--------

The plugin register to the following events :

bz_eGameStartEvent
bz_eGetAutoTeamEvent
bz_ePlayerPartEvent
bz_ePlayerPausedEvent
bz_ePlayerUpdateEvent
bz_eGameEndEvent
bz_eSlashCommandEvent


It also implements the followiing commands :

/official
/cancel
/ladder
/online

The command /official stands for an official declaration of a match. It is like a signature. Nevertheless, 
any official declaration (command /official) can be canceled at anytime by anyone with permission with command /cancel
until command /countdown has been executed.

When player A run command /official, the bzfs plugin asks to webleague patch the name of player A's team.
The webleague patch returns the correct team name by searching in its database. Let denote it by ** TeamA **.
Then the server informs  all the players that ** Team A ** is waiting for a challenger. This can still be canceled 
by command "/cancel" by anyone with the permission AUTOREPORT to define in the groupdb file of the server.    

If a second player enter command /official, the bzfs plugin would  get the player B's team name in the same way. 
Let denote it by ** Team B **.  If ** Team A **  is also ** Team B ** then the plugin would inform that such a match cannot be. 
played. Then, the match is still not set in official mode. If Player A or/and Player B does not belong to any team, then 
a message is sent to all the players to inform on it. The match is not set in official mode. Otherwise, if ** Team A **  
and ** Team B ** are different, then the match is  set in official mode. This mode can still be canceled by command "/cancel".    

While contdown is active (until expired time or gameover), only players of the two declared team can join. 
Other players are redirected to observers room. 

The bzfs plugin will try to guess the colors of the both teams. It can check if teams are mixed or not.
It can also check if a tank is [nr] or [pause]. Consequently, it can check if teams are even or if more than 1 players are playing
in each team. In case teams are not even, or there are less than 2 players per team, then the plugin will auto pause the countdown.

If a match is ended by command /gameover, then it will not be reported. 

WEBLEAGUE PATCH INSTALL
-----------------------

Let denote the root directory of your webleague installation by WEBDIR. Let also denote the directory where the files of the 
autoreport plugin are copied by SOURCEDIR. In order to install the webleague patch, files 

-- copy/overwrite the two files in SOURCEDIR (autoreport_plugin.php and index.php) to WEBDIR/
-- copy SOURCEDIR/webleague/section/autoreport.php into WEBDIR/section/
-- copy/overwrite files into SOURCEDIR/webleague/support/sqlscripts/create_new_install to  WEBDIR/support/sqlscripts/create_new_install
-- copy the directory  SOURCEDIR/webleague/support/sqlscripts/add_autoreport into WEBDIR/support/sqlscripts/

WEBLEAGUE PATCH USE
-------------------

The next step is to update the sql database. Actually, a table will be added with respect to the default webleague database
Consequently, for a new install, just change directory to WEBDIR/support/sqlscripts/ and execute script runme.sh. In case 
of an update of an previously existing database, change directory to  WEBDIR/support/sqlscripts/add_autoreport and 
execute script runme.sh.

Let assume that WEBSITE_URL is the url of the webleague site. 
Connect to WEBSITE_URL and login as an admin. the frontend to add/edit/remove HASH string of official match league server is 
available thru the link "autoreport" in the admin panel. A new permission "AutoReport" has been introduced to allow/deny access
to the frontend. 

Create a new player with callsign "autoreport". All auto-reports will be made with its id (the password is not needed either by
the bzfs plugin or the webleague patch). 
 
BZFS PLUGIN INSTALL
-------------------

Let again denote the directory where the files of the autoreport plugin are copied by SOURCEDIR. The first step is to change 
directory to SOURCEDIR/AutoReport. There is a MakeFile that allows to compile the plugin by just running the command make.  It will 
create a new file, AutoReport.so <-- it is the bzfs plugin!!!! Copy SOURCEDIR/AutoReport.so into a directory where it could be 
load by bzfs. Let denote by PLUGIN_PATH such a directory.

BZFS PLUGIN USE
---------------

The plugin can be loaded in the command line with the required parameters separated by a quote. The first parameter has to be 
the link of the php patch that handles connection with bzfs plugin. By default, it is  autoreport_handle.php. The second 
parameter is a hash string that is used to validate the identity of the bzfs server side. Let assume the hash string is 
774320FJCFIE9484292E2DE24. Consequently, the command line would be

bzfs -loadplugin PLUGIN_PATH/AutoReport.so,http://WEBSITE_URL/autoreport_handle.php,774320FJCFIE9484292E2DE24 [...]

It is recommended to change the default name of the file autoreport_handle.php into WEBDIR. It would improve security.
